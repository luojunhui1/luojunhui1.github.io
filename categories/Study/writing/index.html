<h2><span id="ninth-week">NINTH WEEK</span></h2><h4><span id="excise">excise</span></h4><p>You are required to write a <strong>one-paragraph summary</strong> based on the following essay. You have to write <strong>less than 180 words</strong> and mention the original author and text in your summary. </p>
<p>&#x200B;                                        <strong>Women&#x2019;s</strong> <strong>Liberation and Feminism</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;     In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women&#x2019;s liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. ==This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family and also for society itself with greater gender equality.== </p>
<p>The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women&#x2019;s liberation and feminism. The ==women&#x2019;s liberation== movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. Because of feminist ideas, ==men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only,== most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, ==women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests==. These have led to some significant effects, both on family life and on society as a whole. </p>
<p>&#x200B;     Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, ==she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income==. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the ==pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband&#x2019;s and the wife&#x2019;s emotional wellbeing==. Additionally, the ==purchasing power of the family will also be raised.== This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is ==the promotion of independence in the children==. Children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This therefore teaches them important life skills. </p>
<p>&#x200B;     As regards society, ==the most significant impact of women going to work is greater gender equality.== There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This in turn has led to greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just employment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;     In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as affecting society itself. It is clear that the ==sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life==, however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. </p>

<h4><span id="my-answer">My Answer</span></h4><p>In &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s Liberation and Feminism&#x201D;, Arking(2009) analyzes the influence of  women&#x2019;s liberation and feminism on family and society. First, the author states that those feminist ideas  prompted men to take those works that are usually for women only and enabled women to pursue their own career and interests. The author then points out that women can make a contribution to family income, which not only reduces the pressure of husband but also promotes the purchasing power of family and children&#x2019;s independence.  Finally, the author argues that gender equality still has a long way to go.</p>

<h2><span id="sixteen-week">SIXTEEN WEEK</span></h2><p>The concept of &#x2018;the body&#x2019; is closely related to the ideas of &#x2018;illness&#x2019; and &#x2018;health&#x2019;. All the people exist in &#x2018;bodies&#x2019; of different shapes, heights, colors and physical abilities. The main reasons for the differences are ==genetic==, and the fact that people&#x2019;s bodies change as they ==age==. However, ==a huge range of research indicates that there are social factors too.==</p>
<p>==Poorer people== are more likely to eat &#x2018;unhealthy&#x2019; foods, to smoke cigarettes and to be employed in repetitive, physically difficult work or the opposite: boring, inactive employment. All of these factors impact upon the condition of a person&#x2019;s health: ==the physical shapes of bodies are strongly influenced by social factors==. ==These social factors are also closely linked to emotional wellbeing.== People with low or no incomes are more likely to have mental health problems. It is not clear, however, whether poverty causes mental illness, or whether it is the other way around. For example, certain people with mental health issues may be at risk of becoming homeless, just as a person who is homeless may have an increased risk of illnesses such as depression.</p>
<p>There are ==other types of social factors== too. Bodies are young or old, short or tall, big or small, weak or strong. Whether these judgments matter and whether they are positive or negative depends on the ==cultural and historical context==. What is considered as attractive or ugly, normal or abnormal varies enormously. Currently, for example, in rich societies the idea of slimness is highly valued, but historically this was different. In most societies the ideal body shape for a woman was a &#x2018;full figure&#x2019; with a noticeable belly, while in middle-aged men, a large stomach indicated that they were financially successful in life.</p>
<p>It is easy for people to feel undervalued because of factors they have no power to change, for example, their age and height. Equally, they can feel ==pressured== into making changes to their appearance when there is a choice, which in extreme cases can ==lead to obsessions with weight loss and fitness regimes.==</p>
<p>Sociologists, then, are suggesting that we should ==not just view bodies and minds in biological terms, but also in social terms==. The physical body and what we seek to do with it change over time and society. This has important implications for medicine and ideas of health. Thus, the idea of people being &#x2018;obese&#x2019; is physically related to large amounts of processed food, together with lack of exercise, and is therefore a medical issue. However, it has also become a mental health issue and social problem as a result of people coming to define this particular body shape as &#x2018;wrong&#x2019; and unhealthy.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>In the text &#x201C;The Body&#x201D;,  Geyte (2009) states that the differences of body are not just caused by genes and age but also social factors. Firstly, the author indicates that  person&#x2019;s physical shape and emotional wellbeing may related to economic situation . Secondly,  the evaluation standards for body are depending on the specific cultural and historical context.  Thirdly, people may feel pressured about their appearance, which may lead to obsessions with  weight loss. In the final section of this article, the author summarizes that  we should treat bodies and minds issues as  both biological and social terms.</p>
